compiler vs Interpretor


complier .

it will transulate  a code to machine code once and store in .class file

Interpretor:

It will transulate and will not create the transulted code.
you have to transulate every time.



Compiler
• Compiler will convert program into machine code if they are no error
• Compilation from source code to machine code is done only once
• As translation is done once that’s why compiler doesn't run codes
• Even if there’s one error in the program , it will not compile the full code
must be error free to transform into machine code.
Interpreter
• JavaScript is an interpreter based language
• JS runs inside browser , it cannot run independently
• It translate and runs /executes the code line by line
• Translation is done again and again


• Compiler is faster than interpreter
• In interpreter if there is error in one line the code will still execute
• Interpreter language is easy than compiler language


Java is Hybrid ---(Complier and Interpreter).

JVM  ---> Interpreter / JIT Complier(just in time).
