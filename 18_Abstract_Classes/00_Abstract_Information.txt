There	are	two	types	of	classes	Abstract	class	and	Concrete	class	

If	abstract	keyword	is	used	before	the	class	then	it	is	an	Abstract	
Class	if	nothing	is	written	before	class	then	it	is	a	Concrete	class	


Object	of	an	Abstract	class	cannot	be	created	but	object	of	Concrete	
class	can	be	created


reference	of	abstract	class	is	allowed

Method	which	is	not	having	a	body	is	known	as	Abstract	method,	
the	method	must	be	declared	as	abstract		

The	abstract	method	is	unde7ined	method	


A	class	is	Abstract	class	if	at	least	one	of	the		methods	is	abstract	


If	any	other	class	inherits	abstract	class	then	that	class	also	becomes	
abstract	class	but	to	become	a	concrete	class	the	subclass	must	
override	the	unde?ined	method	

A	class	becomes	useful	if	it	overrides	all	the	methods	of	abstract	class

	
• Abstract	classes	are	used	for	imposing	standards	and	sharing	methods	

• Sub	classes	are	meant	for	following	standards

............ Does and Donts.......


An	Abstract	class	cannot	be	?inal	because	if	it	is	made	?inal	then	it	
cannot	be	extended	whereas	abstract	class	is	meant	for	
inheritance	
• An	Abstract	method	cannot	be	?inal	because	if	it	made	?inal	then	it	
cannot	be	overridden	whereas	Abstract	method	is	meant	for	
overriding		
• Abstract	Class	and	method	can	neither	be	?inal	nor	static		
• A	Sub	class	must	override	an	abstract	method	or	else	it	will	become	
abstract	class
